# Alex Sullivan

Hi, My name is Alex Sullivan and I am a recent graduate from California State University Channel Islands. I graduated in December of 2021 with a computer
science degree. Feel free to take a look at some of the projects here. Some are older school projects while others are more recent examples of
my personal projects.

## Employment

### Embedded Peer Educator (2021)

In this role I served as a peer tutor for other Computer Science students. I was embedded in COMP-151 Data structures and program design, meaning I attended class
and worked with the professor in order to suppor students learning. Further I tutored students one-on-one in the following courses: Computer Networking, Programming
Languages, Calculus, and UNIX systems programming.
